How are you going to store all the files? Are all the files going to be in the same folder or directory? If you plan on having lots of different pictures and files, it's recommended that you store the pages, files, and pictures in separate directories.
Are the HTML files going to be stored as .HTM or .HTML files? There is no advantage or disadvantage of going with .htm or .html. However, it is a good idea to stick with the same extension.
Do you plan on having a template for the pages? Are all the pages going to have the same overall look and feel?
How is the navigation going to be handled? Do you feel its better for the navigation menu to be on the left, bottom, or top of each page?
Tip 
Realize that your web page is going to change over time as you find things that do not work. Over the lifetime of the Computer Hope website, we have changed our complete site several dozen times.

Steps
1:creating a file named index.htm or index.html as your start page. All servers on the Internet look for an index file if no file is specified. For example, when typing https://www.computerhope.com, the server is accessing the https://www.computerhope.com/index.htm address. (the code starts with '<html>', which is defining that everything within '<html>' is HTML code. Next, you have '<head>', which is defining the heading of your HTML document. Third, we have the '<title>' section within '<head>', which defines the web page title that is displayed at the top of the Internet browser window. Finally, the <body> section contains what is shown on the web page.)('<center>', which is telling the browser to center the information in these tags. Next, the '<h1>' or heading one statement tells the browser to display the text in the largest heading style. Next, the <hr> tag tells the browser to display a line straight across the screen. The third line contains <br> that creates a line break on the page. Next, the '<p>' is short for "paragraph" and helps separate the text on the page. Next, the <b> tag is short for bold and will bold the text contained in the tag. Next, the '<ul>' starts a bullet list and each bullet is represented by the *<li>* tag. Finally, the "'<a href'" tag is a method of creating a link to another location. In this example, we are creating a bulleted list of links to Computer Hope and Google.)
  2.There are two methods of displaying images on your web page. The first method is linking to another website to display the images by using the below code.
'<img src="https://www.computerhope.com/logo.gif" alt="logo">'
Using the above HTML tag, you can display images located on other websites, which is also called a hotlink. However, we advise against using this type of link, as it can cause your web page to load slower and could cause missing images to occur if the other site removes the images. The alternate and recommended method would be to use the below code.
<img src="mypic.gif" alt="My picture">
Or if you have an "images" folder:
<img src="images/mypic.gif" alt="My images picture">
  3.When accessing files in other directories that are ahead of the current directory, first specify the directory and then the file name. For example, if you are trying to access or display the image file mypic.gif in the image folder, create the link as shown below.
image/mypic.gif. Next, if you wanted to access the image file mypic.gif that is back one directory, you would want to use the example below.
../mypic.gif(This rule can be applied to as many directories back as possible. For example, if you wanted to go back three directories and then go into the images directory, then you would use the example below.
../../../image/mypic.gif.)(A local path works fine on the computer hard drive (locally); however, when posted on the Internet, no one but the person with the file locally will be able to display the file.)(Finally, remember when specifying the directory that you are using a forward slash (/) and not a backslash.)
  4. ISPs (Internet service providers) and web hosting companies provide FTP (File Transfer Protocol) access that allows the users to copy files from your computer to the server. PC users have two possibilities; one is to use the FTP program included with Windows, and the other recommended solution is to download an FTP program. Using one of these tools should enable the user to send his or her files, providing the server allows FTP access.
Once connected to the server, locate the folder or directory that contains your web page. Usually, this folder is public_html. If you are using Windows FTP, type cd public_html or type dir to see what the folder is named. Or open the folder through CuteFTP or the FTP client program you're opening. Once in this folder, you can send your HTML files to the server to access them over the Internet. Windows FTP users to send your files, for example, type send index.htm.
