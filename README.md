How are you going to store all the files? Are all the files going to be in the same folder or directory? If you plan on having lots of different pictures and files, it's recommended that you store the pages, files, and pictures in separate directories.
Are the HTML files going to be stored as .HTM or .HTML files? There is no advantage or disadvantage of going with .htm or .html. However, it is a good idea to stick with the same extension.
Do you plan on having a template for the pages? Are all the pages going to have the same overall look and feel?
How is the navigation going to be handled? Do you feel its better for the navigation menu to be on the left, bottom, or top of each page?
